# 🇮🇳 Offline, Privacy-Preserving Hindi Voice Assistant  
## Bharat AI-SoC Student Challenge  
### Problem Statement 1 – Embedded Offline Hindi Voice Assistant on Raspberry Pi

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project implements a fully offline Hindi Voice Assistant running on a **Raspberry Pi 4 (2GB RAM)**. The assistant processes Hindi voice commands locally using on-device Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and Text-to-Speech (TTS) without any cloud dependency.

The system performs:

- 🎤 Speech-to-Text using Vosk Hindi Model  
- 🧠 Intent Recognition using custom Python logic  
- 🔊 Text-to-Speech using eSpeak-NG  
- 🌐 Website launching  
- 💻 Application launching  
- 🕒 Time and Date queries  
- 🔐 100% Offline processing  

All inference runs entirely on the Raspberry Pi CPU.
